'''
If the array has less elements than required, it will adjust from the end accordingly.

Note: We also have the method split() available but it will not adjust the elements when elements are less in source array for splitting like in example above,
array_split() worked properly but split() would fail.

newarr = np.array_split(arr, 4)
